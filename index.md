# About UHire

UHire is a Meteor application that provides company and student profiles. Based on the information provided companies can contact students to hire, or the students can view companies they are interested in. 

# Development History 

The development process for UHire conformed to [Issue Driven Project Management](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f16/modules/project-management/) practices. In a nutshell, development consists of a sequence of Milestones. Milestones consist of issues corresponding to 2-3 day tasks. GitHub projects are used to manage the processing of tasks during a milestone.  

UHire is being developed by 	Dre Cardinalli, John Yap, Keoni Fontanilla, Kyle Okamoto, and Peter Newton


## Milestone 1: Mockup development

This milestone started on April 1, 2019 and is currently in progress.

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create a set of HTML pages providing a mockup of the pages in the system. To simplify things, the mockup was developed as a Meteor app. This meant that each page was a template and changed accordingly.
Mockups for the following four pages were implemented during M1:

Milestone 1 was implemented as [UHire GitHub Milestone M1](https://github.com/uhire/uhire-app/milestone/1)::

Milestone 1 consisted of fourteen issues, and progress was managed via the [uhire GitHub Project M1]

Each issue was implemented in its own branch, and merged into master when completed.
