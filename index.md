# Overview

In a nutshell, development consists of a sequence of Milestones. Milestones consist of issues corresponding to 2-3 day tasks. GitHub projects are used to manage the processing of tasks during a milestone.

## Milestone 1: Mockup development

This milestone started on April 1, 2019 and is was finished on April 8, 2019.

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create a set of HTML pages providing a mockup of the pages in the system. To simplify things, the mockup was developed as a Meteor app. This meant that each page was a template and changed accordingly.
Mockups for the following four pages were implemented during M1:

Milestone 1 was implemented as [UHire GitHub Milestone M1](https://github.com/uhire/uhire-app/projects/1)::

Milestone 1 consisted of fourteen issues, and progress was managed via the [uhire GitHub Project M1]

Each issue was implemented in its own branch, and merged into master when completed.
